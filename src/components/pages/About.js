            I am a Full Stack Software Engineer in the NYC with a Bachelor/'s
            Degree and 6+ years professional experience in Business
            Administration. I am a naturally curious person which makes me want
            to always learn new things, a problem-solver who questions
            everything, and a hard worker who doesn't take life too seriously
            and enjoys the little small things in life like pizza.üçï
