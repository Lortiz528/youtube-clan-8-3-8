            <p>I am Full Stack Software Engineer in the NYC with a Bachelor/'s Degree and 6+ years professional experience in Business Administration. I am a naturally curious person which makes me want to always learn new things, a problem-solver who questions everything, and a hard worker who doesn't take life too seriously and enjoys the little small things in life like pizza.üçï</p>
